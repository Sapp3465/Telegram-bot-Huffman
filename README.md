# Telegram-bot-Huffman

This telegram bot encodes your messages using Huffman's algorithm.
One of the first algorithms for efficient coding of information was proposed by D. A. Huffman in 1952.The idea of the algorithm is this: knowing the probability of occurrence of characters in the message, 
you can describe the procedure for constructing variable length codes, which consist of an entire number of bits. 
Symbols are more likely to match short codes.
Huffman codes have the prefix property (that is, no codeword is a prefix of another), which allows them to decode uniquely
